            Everyone knows gun violence is “bad” and “deadly” and “increasing,” but as a designer and artist, I know those nebulous ideas become more unsettling once they have a concrete realization.  I wanted to take hard facts and numbers and repackage them in a way that cannot be ignored or glossed over.

                <em style="color: #23a3be;">The flag represents one victim of gun violence</em>, not specific to mass shootings, homicide, suicide, domestic violence, or accidental death. Each person has a daily social network (i.e. personal interaction, not via the internet) of 50-100 people. Each of the 50 stars represents one person directly and viscerally affected by the death of a gun violence victim. It is hung upside down to mimic distress signals of ships at sea, and to indicate that America, in a sense, is a ship sinking amid great distress. <br><br>

            It is comprised of sheets to reflect another well-known distress signal: sheets can be hung out a window of a home when someone is trapped inside. Additionally, all the bedclothes have been slept on. A terrifying intimacy blossoms from this choice. Beds are a place of vulnerability and relaxation, and this piece represents the violation of human life.

            A cornerstone decision of this work was to make a flag of my own, rather than deface a “real” flag. As a fierce patriot and lover of this country, <em style="color: #23a3be;">I didn’t think I could bring myself to alter Old Glory</em>, after which I am named. But the choice to create a flag raises a host of unexpected questions. One viewer asked me, “Why don’t you consider your work to be a flag? It certainly looks and acts like one. Is it intrinsically different than the one we fly on the flagpole?”
<br> <br>
I was forced to consider that my flag was made with greater time, effort, and even love than a store-bought flag made in China. Although one was made to be flown and one was made to be art, which held more significance? Which was more authentic? <br><br>
            <em style="color: #23a3be;">Did I commit the very grievance I was hoping to avoid by creating this flag with such care?</em>

        The final work was more that just a story of violence in modern America. It was a story of lines in the sand, of identity, and of striving to be worthy of the dream for which the flag flies.
