        <p>Jupiter is named after the Roman king of the gods, known as Zeus in Greek mythology. A giant red gaseous planet, it is easily spottable in the night sky at varying times thoughout the year. Jupiter has at least 67 known moons, but the most prominent are the four moons first discovered by Galileo: Europa, Calisto, Io, and Ganymede. Other well-known features of the Solar System's largest planet include its distinct light-dark banding and the Great Red Spot.</p>

            Observed consistently since 1879, this massive storm is located  south of Jupiter's equator and is observable though most telescopes on a clear night. It rotates counterclockwise and is documented as dwindling in size and intensity, with the first time-lapse images of the spot taken by the <em>Voyager</em> spacecraft in 1966.
