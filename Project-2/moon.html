        <p>The Moon is a bright and beautiful part of Earth's night sky. Tidally locked to the Earth, we only ever see one side. When the moon was young, it rotated on an axis, much like the Earth. Eventually it became "tidally locked" to the Earth, meaning Earth's gravitational pull overcame the motion of rotation. Contrary to popular belief, the side we do not see is not the "dark side of the moon." Whichever half of the moon is facing the sun will always be lit, and during a New Moon (as seen from Earth) the far side is fully lit, as a Full Moon would be for us on Earth. </p>

        <p>
            Known as <em>mare</em>, the Latin word for "seas," the dark swaths across the face of the moon were once liquid. In the moon's early eons it had a liquid core of magma, much like the Earth. When large galatic fragments or meteors collided with the moon, the surface cracked releasing oceans of magma. As the moon became tidally locked to the Earth, these seas of lava were pulled by Earth's gravity to the Earth-facing side of the moon before solidifying into the dark seas we see today. As a result, there are no <em>mare</em> on the far side of the moon.

            Tycho Crater
            </h1>
        <p>
            Named after famous 16th century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, Tycho crater is 85km in diameter, located deep in the southern hemisphere of the moon. As a well-preserved crater, Tycho is often studied to uncover the mechanics of impact formation. Its impact site and resulting blast rays are visible through a telescope as prominent light spots on the southeast side of the moon.
