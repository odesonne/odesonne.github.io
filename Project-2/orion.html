        <p>In Greek mythology, Orion was a great hunter, tutored by Artemis herself. Accounts of his death vary, though a common myth recounts that he was killed by a scorpion, and after his death he was placed among the stars with his two hunting dogs, <em>Canis major</em> and <em>Canis minor</em>. One of the most identifiable constellations, <em>Orion</em> can be seen with his shield and club in-hand, and a sword at his waist. In conjunction with the story of his death, he is pursued in the sky by the constellation <em>Scorpius</em>.</p>
