        <p>In Greek mythology, Orion was a great hunter, tutored by Artemis,  Goddess of the Hunt herself. Accounts of his death vary, though a common myth recounts that he was killed by a scorpion, and after his death he was placed among the stars with his two hunting dogs, <em>Canis major</em> and <em>Canis minor</em>. One of the most identifiable constellations, <em>Orion</em> can be seen with his shield and club in-hand, and a sword at his waist. In conjunction with the story of his death, he is pursued in the sky by the constellation <em>Scorpius</em>.</p>

            </h1>
        <p>
            Orion's Belt is comprised of three bright stars in a near-straight line. From left to right, they are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka. From his belt hangs Orion's "sword," which is Orion's Nebula.

            Rigel
            </h1>
        <p>
            Rigel is the brightest component of Orion, and is not one but three stars in a triple star system. Rigel A is the brightest and Rigel B and C make up a dimmer binary star system. From Earth, the three stars resolve to the naked eye as one bright blue star.

        <h1>
            Betelgeuse
            </h1>
        <p>
            Betelgeuse is the red supergiant that sits at Orionâ€™s eastern shoulder, and is one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye. A fascinating star with a unique galactic history, Betelgeuse is a young but rapidly evolving star due to its high mass. In the late stages of its stellar evolution, it is due to explode as a supernova in the next one million years.
